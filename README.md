Welcome to my Brick Breaker game implemented in Java! This classic arcade game puts your reflexes and precision to the test as you control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks.

## Gameplay

In this Brick Breaker game, your goal is to eliminate all the bricks on the screen by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. Move the paddle left and right to guide the ball towards the bricks, breaking them on contact. Be careful not to let the ball fall past the paddle, as you'll lose a life!

## Features

- Intuitive controls: Use the left and right arrow keys to control the paddle.
- Different types of bricks: Some bricks require multiple hits to break, while others might contain power-ups or bonuses.
- Power-ups: Look out for power-ups that can help you, such as extra lives, larger paddles, and faster balls.
- Scoring: Earn points for each brick you break. Try to achieve the highest score possible!
Feel free to explore the code and customize the game to your liking. Have fun playing!
